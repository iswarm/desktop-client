#Stellar-mobile-wallet

## Why we need the wallet app?

- App wallet can be used any time, any place as long as you have a smart phone.
- This App supports Chinese language.
- Keep secret key local can make it safer.
- This App is in development from stellar desktop wallet. App will be available for download soon. It was tested on Lenovo A391e70, an andriod phone.

## Reference

- The file encrypt/decrypt part can refer the [ripple desktop client](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-client-desktop).
- Some page layout we refer [stellarterm](https://github.com/stellarterm), it is a good web client. We only refer some HTML and CSS.
- This App is built using Hbuilder
- The layout is very different from stellar desktop-client because addresses, issuers and logo are too long to display.
-
